# Preparing to Develop a Parachain
During the workshop we'll do a live coding example of turning an ordinary Substrate chain into a cumulus-based collator.

You will need to have a runtime, or runtime pallet already written before the workshop.

Learn about Substrate runtime development at the [Substrate developer hub](https://substrate.dev).
