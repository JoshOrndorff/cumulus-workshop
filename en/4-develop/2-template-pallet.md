# Modifying the Template Pallet

The Parachain Template comes with a template pallet at `pallets/template` just like the Node
Template.

Modify this pallet by adding storage items.

Follow the [PoE tutorial](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/build-a-dapp/). Although it was
written for the node template, it works nearly identically here.
