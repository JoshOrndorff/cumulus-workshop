# Your **Relay Chain** Specification

You will need a chain specification for your relay chain network. You can use one that is included
with this workshop, or create your own. 

> An important requirement to keep in mind: you *must*
> always have one more relay chain validator than you have connected parachains. 
>
> **For example, if you want to connect two parachains,**
>**you need *at least* three validators in the relay chain!**

Whichever spec you choose to use we will refer to it simply as `chain-spec.json` in the instructions below.
You will need to supply the proper path to the spec file you are using. **These _conventionally_ live**
**in a `/res` folder that is published in your node's codebase for others to use**. As an example:

- Polkadot includes [these **relay chain** `chain-spec.json` files](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res)
- Cumulus includes [these **parachain** `chain-spec.json` files](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/rococo-parachains/res)

> If you intend to let other connect to your network **you must** have the genesis Wasm the associated and chain spec
> for your network on _one machine_ and have a way for all other nodes to copy this _exact file_ on starting thier nodes.
> This stems from [non-determinism](https://dev.to/gnunicorn/hunting-down-a-non-determinism-bug-in-our-rust-wasm-build-4fk1))
> in the way Wasm runtimes are compiled, at least for now. Thus including it in your codebase is best practice!

For just seeing if things work, we suggest you use one of the [precompiled raw](#_1a-using-a-prebuilt-chain-spec) specifications we
have included for you. If you want to customize your network, jump to [create your chain spec](#_1b-create-your-own-chain-spec).

In either case, if you use a **plain** chain spec (human readable) you want to convert it to a SCALE encoded **raw** chain spec to
use in when starting your nodes. Jump to the [conversion section](#_2-convert-to-raw-chain-spec) to see how to do that.  

## 1.a) Using A Prebuilt Chain Spec

This workshop contains three chain-spec files that you can use **without modification** for a
local test network:

<!-- for some reason these links can't be markdown. See https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/cumulus-workshop/issues/16 -->

- <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom.json" download>shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom.json</a>: A two-validator relay
  chain with Alice and Bob as authorities. Useful for registering a single parachain. 
  **This is a direct export of the `rococo-local` spec that is**
  **[included in polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res).**
  - Plain chain spec: <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-plain.json" download>shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-plain.json</a> 

- <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-3.json" download>shared/chainspecs/rococo-local-3.json</a>: A three-validator relay chain
  identical to `rococo-custom.json` but with Charlie as a third validator.
  - Plain chain spec:  <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-plain-3.json" download>shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-plain-3.json</a>  

- <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-4.json" download>shared/chainspecs/rococo-local-4.json</a>: A four-validator relay chain
  identical to `rococo-custom.json` but with Charlie and Dave as a third and fourth validator.s
  - Plain chain spec: <a href="shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-plain-4.json" download>shared/chainspecs/rococo-custom-plain-4.json</a> 

All `*plain.json` files included are used to inspect in a more human readable and modifiable format that can also be used to derive 
a [new custom raw spec](#adjust-the-chain-spec).

These specs were created according to the steps in the next section. If you would like even more
validators, or to customize the relay chain in some other way, keep reading, otherwise 
**[start your relay chain](en/2-relay-chain/1-launch)** with a **raw chain spec file**.

<!-- > These specs are also present in the Polkadot docker image and can be used when running in Docker. -->

## 1.b) Create Your Own Chain Spec

As with any Substrate chain, you can always create your own chain spec file. It is generally best to start
from an existing specification, as developing one from scratch is outside the scope of this tutorial.
For those interested in this, see the [Further Resources](#chain-specification) section below.
For now, we will use Polkadot's built-in `rococo-local` as our starting point for our custom spec.

### Generate a Plain Chain Spec

```bash
# Create a base chain spec that we will modify
polkadot build-spec --chain rococo-local --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom-plain.json
```

That file contains most of the information we need already. Rococo is a permissioned chain, so
we just need to add an authority and its session keys. The snippet below shows the relevant part of
the generated spec file. All keys in the generated file belong to the usual well known accounts used
in other tutorials (Alice and Bob in the case of the `rococo-custom-plain.json` file).

```json
"palletSession": {
  "keys": [
    [
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",                           // <---- The Validator Authority (//Alice//stash)
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",
      {
        "grandpa": "5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu",              // <---- The GRANDPA ed25519 session key (//Alice)
        "babe": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",                 // <---- The sr25519 session keys (//Alice)
        "im_online": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY", 
        "para_validator": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "para_assignment": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "authority_discovery": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "beefy": "KW39r9CJjAVzmkf9zQ4YDb2hqfAVGdRqn53eRqyruqpxAP5YL",               // <---- The BEEFY *encoded* ecdsa session keys (//Alice)
       }
    ],
  // -- snip -- ADD MORE KEYS HERE, following the same format
},
```

### Adjust the Chain Spec

#### Generate Authority and Session Keys

Add your new authority's `AccountId` and `ValidatorId`.

In this runtime configuration, both IDs are the same and are generated from the "stash" account. You
can generate your own or inspect the 
[well-known development accounts](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey#well-known-keys).

The following commands demonstrate how the first part of the `palletSession` section inside the
spec file can be reproduced. The second part is obtained similarly with `//Bob` and `//Bob//stash`.

> All the keys and addresses needed can be generated using either:
> - The [`subkey` tool](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey) (v2.0.1 and above for BEEFY keys)
> - The `node key` subcommand. (this can be your `polkadot` or `parachain-collator` binary, based on the latest substrate)

Polkadot **validator authority** address for `//Alice//stash` (`sr25519` cryptography):

```bash
# Replace `node` with any substrate based node binary, like `polkadot`
subkey inspect --scheme sr25519 --network substrate //Alice//stash
```
*Output:*
```
Secret Key URI `//Alice//stash` is account:
  Secret seed:       0x3c881bc4d45926680c64a7f9315eeda3dd287f8d598f3653d7c107799c5422b3
  Public key (hex):  0xbe5ddb1579b72e84524fc29e78609e3caf42e85aa118ebfe0b0ad404b5bdd25f
  Public key (SS58): 5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY
  Account ID:        0xbe5ddb1579b72e84524fc29e78609e3caf42e85aa118ebfe0b0ad404b5bdd25f
  SS58 Address:      5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY
```

Polkadot **grandpa session** key for `//Alice` (`ed25519` cryptography):

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme ed25519 --network substrate //Alice
```
*Output:*
```
Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xabf8e5bdbe30c65656c0a3cbd181ff8a56294a69dfedd27982aace4a76909115
  Public key (hex):  0x88dc3417d5058ec4b4503e0c12ea1a0a89be200fe98922423d4334014fa6b0ee
  Public key (SS58): 5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu
  Account ID:        0x88dc3417d5058ec4b4503e0c12ea1a0a89be200fe98922423d4334014fa6b0ee
  SS58 Address:      5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu
```

Polkadot address for `//Alice` (`sr25519` cryptography). This is used in all but the `beefy`
key sections of the chainspec after the `grandpa` key.

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme sr25519 --network substrate //Alice
```
*Output:*
```
Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xe5be9a5092b81bca64be81d212e7f2f9eba183bb7a90954f7b76361f6edb5c0a
  Public key (hex):  0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d
  Public key (SS58): 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
  Account ID:        0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d
  SS58 Address:      5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
```

And finally the **encoded SS58** ecdsa BEEFY key:
```bash
subkey inspect --scheme ecdsa --network substrate //Alice
```
*Output:*
```
Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xcb6df9de1efca7a3998a8ead4e02159d5fa99c3e0d4fd6432667390bb4726854
  Public key (hex):  0x020a1091341fe5664bfa1782d5e04779689068c916b04cb365ec3153755684d9a1
  Public key (SS58): KW39r9CJjAVzmkf9zQ4YDb2hqfAVGdRqn53eRqyruqpxAP5YL
  Account ID:        0x01e552298e47454041ea31273b4b630c64c104e4514aa3643490b8aaca9cf8ed
  SS58 Address:      5C7C2Z5sWbytvHpuLTvzKunnnRwQxft1jiqrLD5rhucQ5S9X
```

Notice the BEEFY key is the `Public key (SS58)` and it's _different_ from the `SS58 Address` in the
case of ECDSA keys (see [the note below](#ss58-encoding-of-key-vs-address) on why).

> Phew! That was a lot of keys! To learn more about *why and how* these are used, see the 
> [session keys](session-keys) section below.

#### Add Your Keys to the `custom-plain.json` File

Now that you have all the keys you need, append them in the `palletSession` section of you *plain* spec file.
You can either create new IDs or use other well known accounts following this same process.
You can also proceed with the **raw** `chain-spec.json` files [mentioned above](#using-a-prebuilt-chain-spec).

---

### 2. Convert to Raw Chain Spec

Now that you've created your spec, you can generate the final raw spec file.

> Your final spec _must_ start with the word `rococo` or the node will not know what runtime logic
> it includes.

```bash
polkadot build-spec --chain rococo-custom-plain.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom.json
```

You may get the output warning: `Took active validators from set with wrong size`.
The resulting `chain-spec.json` will still be **perfectly usable**, you can ignore this safely.

## Further Resources

This custom session key addition in the plain is not needed for **production chains** - as these 
are generated for you from your `chain-spec.rs` file more simply and concretely. This exercise above is 
used because you _must recompile your node_ for just adding authorities in this case!
So if all you need to do is configure minor things off of a know base chain spec, as we did, you will want
to set the information in `chain-spec.rs`, and generate the binary and finally use the CLI to generate 
your custom chain spec. 

### Chain Specification

To learn more about things beyond what we did and more that can be configured, check out
these resources on understanding chain specs:

- https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/start-a-private-network/customspec#create-a-chain-specification
- https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/chain-spec

### Session Keys

The [fn `impl_opaque_keys!`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/primitives/runtime/src/traits.rs#L1186-L1321)
macro *implements* [`type Keys`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/session/src/lib.rs#L386)
that is [used in rococo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/runtime/rococo/src/lib.rs#L173-L183)
to actually [generate all the keys](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/runtime/rococo/src/lib.rs#L1117-L1127).
This ingests the keys you set in your
[chain_spec.rs](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/node/service/src/chain_spec.rs#L174-L192) 
file for you when you _compile your runtime_ based on what you configure 
[in this section](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/node/service/src/chain_spec.rs#L656) of that file.

The BEEFY key is encoded, this is derived in the [polkadot launch CLI tool](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-launch/blob/89e9704c8addd7f4dffa7cc75236393fd8c80bab/src/spec.ts#L68) using the [@polkadot-js/util-crypto](https://github.com/polkadot-js/common/tree/master/packages/util-crypto) node package [here](https://github.com/polkadot-js/common/blob/e7e82443231b75b7a546b462a63385db82a57f36/packages/keyring/src/pair/index.ts#L115) as a [SS58 encoded key](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/ss58-address-format) of the form:

```
base58encode ( concat ( <address-type>, <address>, <checksum> ) )
```

Fortunately, `subkey` and the `node key` subcommand will generate this for you! So no need to 
worry about the details any more here.

#### SS58 Encoding of Key vs. Address

In case of sr25519 and ed25519 crypto, the account id matches public key, hence SS58 encoded
account-id address is the same as SS58 public key encoding.

In case of ECDSA, we blake2 the public key to get the address (due to size difference
33 vs 32 bytes), so the SS58 encoding was different.

Default Ser/De implementation for public keys is using SS58 encoding, hence every time we use 
public keys in encoded form we are going to need it's SS58 encoding. A notable case is 
chain spec JSON file and encoding of session keys (most importantly BEEFY).
