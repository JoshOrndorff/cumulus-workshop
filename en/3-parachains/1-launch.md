# Launching a Parachain

We'll begin by deploying a parachain template with parachain id `200`. These instructions are written
specifically for parachain id 200, however you can re-use these instructions with any parachain id
by adjusting occurrences of the number 200 accordingly.

Note that the `parachain-collator` command used below comes from the [substrate-parachain-template repo](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/)
that we set up in the Preparation/Compiling step.

## Generate Genesis State

To register a parachain, the relay chain needs to know the parachain's genesis state. The collator
node can export that state to a file for us. The following command will create a file containing the
parachain's entire genesis state, hex-encoded.

```bash
parachain-collator export-genesis-state --parachain-id 200 > para-200-genesis
```

## Obtain Wasm Validation Function

The relay chain also needs the parachain-specific validation logic to validate parachain blocks. The
collator node also has a command to produce this wasm blob.

```bash
parachain-collator export-genesis-wasm > para-200-wasm
```

> The Wasm blob does not depend on the parachain id, so we do not provide that flag. If you are
> launching multiple parachains using the exact same runtime, you do not need to regenerate the Wasm
> blob each time (although it is fast and harmless to do so).

## Start the Collator Node

We can now start the collator node with the following command. Notice that we need to supply the same
relay chain spec we used when launching relay chain nodes.

```bash
parachain-collator \
  --collator \
  --tmp \
  --parachain-id 200 \
  --port 40333 \
  --ws-port 9844 \
  --alice \
  -- \
  --execution wasm \
  --chain <relay chain spec json> \
  --port 30343 \
  --ws-port 9977
```

The first thing to notice about this command is that several arguments are passed before the lone
`--`, and several more arguments are passed after it. A cumulus collator contains the actual
collator node, and also an embedded relay chain node. The arguments before the `--` are for the
collator, and the arguments after the `--` are for the embedded relay chain node.

We give the collator a base path and ports as we did for the relay chain node previously. We also
specify the parachain id. Remember to change these collator-specific values if you are executing
these instructions a second time for a second parachain. Then we give the embedded relay chain node
the relay chain spec we are using. Finally, we give the embedded relay chain node some peer
addresses.

## Is It Working?

At this point you should see your collator node running and peering with the relay chain nodes. You
should _not_ see it authoring parachain blocks yet. Authoring will begin when the collator is
actually registered on the relay chain (the next step).

At this point your collator's logs should look something like this:
